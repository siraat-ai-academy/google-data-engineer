# 0.2.1 What does a Data Engineer do

---

## 1. Concept Explanation 

A **Data Engineer** is the person who:

> **Builds and maintains systems that move data from one place to another so it can be used.**

In simple words:
- Data Engineers **do not analyse data**
- They **prepare data** so others can use it

Think of a Data Engineer as:
> The person who builds **roads for data**

If roads are broken:
- Cars cannot move  
If data pipelines are broken:
- Reports cannot work

## 2. What Problem Does a Data Engineer Solve?

In real companies:

- Data comes from many places:
  - Apps
  - Websites
  - Databases
  - Sensors
  - External partners

Problems:
- Data is messy
- Data is too big
- Data comes very fast
- Data breaks often

A Data Engineer:
- Collects data
- Cleans data
- Stores data
- Makes data reliable

---

## 3. Daily Responsibilities of a Data Engineer

Typical work includes:

- Collecting data from sources
- Building data pipelines
- Cleaning and transforming data
- Storing data in databases or warehouses
- Fixing broken data jobs
- Making sure data arrives on time
- Working with analysts and scientists

They focus on:
- Reliability
- Performance
- Scalability

## 4. Data Engineer vs Data Analyst (Very Important)

### Data Engineer:
- Builds pipelines
- Handles raw data
- Works behind the scenes
- Focuses on systems

### Data Analyst:
- Uses prepared data
- Creates reports
- Finds insights
- Works with business teams

👉 Data Engineer enables Data Analyst.

## 5. Data Engineer vs Software Engineer

### Data Engineer:
- Works mainly with data systems
- Handles large data volumes
- Focuses on pipelines and storage

### Software Engineer:
- Builds applications
- Focuses on user features
- Works with APIs and UI

Both are engineers,  
but **problem focus is different**.

## 6. Real-World Example (Very Simple)

### Example: Online Shopping Company

Data sources:
- Orders
- Payments
- User clicks

Data Engineer work:
- Collect order data
- Clean incorrect records
- Store data in warehouse
- Make data ready for reports

Without Data Engineer:
- Reports break
- Decisions are delayed
- Business suffers

---

## 7. Tools Are NOT the Job

Many beginners think:
- “Data Engineer = BigQuery”
- “Data Engineer = SQL only”

Reality:
- Tools change
- Concepts stay

A Data Engineer is valued for:
- Understanding data flow
- Designing stable systems
- Handling failures calmly

---

## 8. Engineer Mindset (Very Important)

Good Data Engineers:
- Think end-to-end
- Assume data can be wrong
- Plan for failures
- Care about long-term stability

They ask:
- Where does data come from?
- What if this fails?
- Can this scale?
- Can others understand this?

---

## 9. How This Role Appears in Interviews

Interviewers may ask:
- What does a Data Engineer do?
- Explain a data pipeline
- How do you ensure data reliability?

Good answers are:
- Simple
- Practical
- Example-based

Avoid memorised definitions.

---

## Key Takeaway

**A Data Engineer builds reliable systems that move and prepare data for others.**

If data is the oil,
then Data Engineers build the **pipes and refineries**.

## Discussion Questions

- Does this role feel interesting to you?
- Do you prefer building systems or analysing results?
