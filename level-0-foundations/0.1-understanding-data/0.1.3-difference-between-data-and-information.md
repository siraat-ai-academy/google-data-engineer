# 0.1.3 Difference between data and information

---

## 1. Concept Explanation (Very Simple English)

The difference is simple:

- **Data** = raw facts (no meaning by itself)
- **Information** = data that is processed and understood

Think like this:

> **Data answers “what?”**  
> **Information answers “what does it mean?”**

---

## 2. Simple One-Line Definition

- **Data:** Raw values without context  
- **Information:** Meaningful result after processing data

---

## 3. Daily Life Examples (Very Important)

### Example 1: Temperature

- Data:
```

30, 31, 32

```

- Information:
```

Temperature is increasing

```

👉 Numbers alone are data  
👉 Understanding the pattern is information

---

### Example 2: Exam Result

- Data:
```

Marks = 85

```

- Information:
```

Student passed with good score

```

---

### Example 3: Bank Account

- Data:
```

-2000

```

- Information:
```

Money was withdrawn from account

```

---

## 4. Business Example (Real Job Context)

### Example: Online Store

- Data:
- 100 orders
- ₹500 average price

- Information:
- “Total sales = ₹50,000 today”

- Decision (next step):
- Increase stock
- Run promotions

👉 Data → Information → Decision

## 5. Key Differences (Easy Table)

| Aspect | Data | Information |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Meaning | No | Yes |
| Processed | No | Yes |
| Useful alone | No | Yes |
| Example | `100` | “100 users visited” |
| Used for decisions | No | Yes |

## 6. Why Companies Care About This Difference

Companies do NOT make decisions on raw data.

They:
1. Collect data
2. Clean data
3. Process data
4. Create information
5. Take decisions

If data is wrong:
- Information becomes wrong
- Decisions fail
- Business suffers

That is why **data engineering exists**.

---

## 7. Common Beginner Mistakes

Beginners often think:

- Data = report ❌
- Data = dashboard ❌
- Data = chart ❌

Reality:
- Report uses information
- Dashboard shows information
- Chart visualises information

👉 **Data is always behind the scenes.**

---

## 8. Engineer Mindset (Very Important)

Good Data Engineers always ask:

- Is this data correct?
- Is this data complete?
- What does this data represent?
- How will this data become information?

They never assume:
> “Data is always correct”

---

## 9. Interview Angle (Beginner Level)

Interviewers may ask:
- What is the difference between data and information?

Best answer:
- Simple
- With example
- No complex words

Simple answers show **clear thinking**.

---

## Key Takeaway

**Data is raw.  
Information is meaningful.**

Without data → no information  
Without information → no decisions  

This difference is the **foundation of data engineering**.

---

## Discussion Questions

- Can you think of data you used today?
- When did that data become information?
- Would you like to learn **0.1.4 Why companies collect data** next?
- Or should we continue LEVEL 0 step-by-step?
