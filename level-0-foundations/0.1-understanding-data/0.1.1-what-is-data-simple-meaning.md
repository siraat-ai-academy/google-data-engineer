# 0.1.1 What is data (simple meaning)

---

## 1. Concept Explanation 

**Data** means:

> **Raw facts or values that are collected, but not yet explained.**

Data by itself:
- Has no meaning
- Is not a decision
- Is just a record

Think of data as:
- Numbers
- Text
- Dates
- Signals

When data is **processed and understood**, it becomes **information**.

---

## 2. Data Explained with Daily Life Examples

### Example 1: Temperature
- Data: `32, 33, 34`
- Meaning: Nothing clear yet

When explained:
- “Temperature is increasing”
→ This becomes **information**

---

### Example 2: Exam Marks
- Data: `85`
- Just a number

When explained:
- “Student scored 85% and passed”
→ This is **information**

---

### Example 3: Mobile Usage
- Data:
  - Call duration
  - App usage time
  - Location points

By itself: raw data  
After analysis: usage pattern

---

## 3. Why Data Alone Is Not Enough

Data is:
- Unorganised
- Unclean
- Sometimes incorrect

Companies do NOT directly use raw data.

They first:
- Collect data
- Clean data
- Transform data
- Analyze data

Only then:
- Decisions are made
- Reports are created
- Business actions happen

---

## 4. Why Companies Collect Data

Companies collect data to:

- Understand customers
- Improve products
- Reduce cost
- Increase profit
- Predict future trends

Examples:
- E-commerce tracks clicks
- Banks track transactions
- Hospitals track patient records
- Apps track user behaviour

All of this starts with **data**.

---

## 5. Common Beginner Confusion

Many beginners think:

- Data = Excel file ❌
- Data = Report ❌
- Data = Dashboard ❌

Reality:
- Excel file stores data
- Report uses data
- Dashboard visualises data

**Data comes first.  
Everything else is built on top of it.**

---

## 6. Best Practice (Engineer Mindset)

Good Data Engineers always remember:

- Data is raw
- Data can be wrong
- Data needs validation
- Data needs context

They never assume:
- “Data is correct by default”

They always ask:
- Where did this data come from?
- Can this data be trusted?
- What does this data represent?

---

## 7. Real-World Example (Job Context)

### Example: Online Shopping App

Raw data collected:
- User clicks
- Time spent on product
- Purchase amount

This data is:
- Stored in databases
- Sent through pipelines

Later used to:
- Recommend products
- Detect fraud
- Improve sales

Without data:
👉 No analytics  
👉 No decisions  
👉 No business growth  

---

## 8. How This Appears in Interviews

Interviewers may ask:
- “What is data?”
- “What kind of data have you worked with?”
- “Difference between data and information?”

Good answer shows:
- Clear understanding
- Simple explanation
- Real-world thinking

Simple explanation is always better than complex words.

---

## Key Takeaway

**Data = raw facts without meaning.  
Information = data with meaning.**

Everything in data engineering:
- Starts with data
- Depends on data
- Succeeds or fails because of data

---

## Discussion Questions

- Can you think of data from your daily life?
- Have you worked with data before without realising it?
- Would you like to see **types of data** next?
- Should we continue with `0.1.2 Examples of data in daily life`?
