# 0.3.2 What is a server

---

## 1. Concept Explanation 

A **server** is:

> **A computer that provides services or data to other computers.**

In simple words:
- Your laptop or mobile = **client**
- Server = **helper computer** that responds to requests

You ask → Server answers.

---

## 2. Simple Daily-Life Example

### Example: WhatsApp / YouTube / Google

When you:
- Send a message
- Watch a video
- Search something

Your phone:
- Sends request

Server:
- Receives request
- Processes it
- Sends response back

👉 Without servers, apps cannot work.

---

## 3. Server vs Normal Computer (Very Important)

### Normal Computer (Laptop / PC):
- Used by one person
- Turned on/off frequently
- Limited power
- Used for personal tasks

### Server:
- Used by **many users**
- Runs **24/7**
- More powerful
- Designed for reliability

A server is still a **computer system**,  
but built for **service**, not personal use.

---

## 4. What Does a Server Do?

A server can:
- Store data
- Run applications
- Handle user requests
- Process data
- Send responses

Examples:
- Web server → shows websites
- Database server → stores data
- File server → stores files

---

## 5. Where Are Servers Located?

Servers are usually kept in:

- **Data centers**
- Special rooms with:
  - Cooling
  - Backup power
  - Security

You usually **never see servers**,
but you use them every day.

---

## 6. Server in Data Engineering (Job Context)

In data engineering:
- Servers run data pipelines
- Servers host databases
- Servers process large data jobs

Examples:
- ETL jobs run on servers
- Data warehouses run on servers
- Streaming systems run on servers

As a Data Engineer:
- You design systems that run on servers
- You don’t manage hardware
- You focus on **data and reliability**

---

## 7. Cloud Server (Important Concept)

Today, many servers are **cloud servers**.

Cloud server means:
- Server is not in your office
- It is provided by cloud companies
- You access it over internet

Example:
- Google Cloud
- AWS
- Azure

Cloud server = **server on internet**

---

## 8. Common Beginner Misunderstanding

Beginners often think:
- Server is a different machine ❌
- Server is only for websites ❌

Reality:
- Server is just a computer
- Difference is **how it is used**
- Any computer can act as a server

Role defines server, not shape.

---

## 9. Interview Angle (Beginner Level)

Interviewers may ask:
- What is a server?

Best answer:
- A computer that provides services to other computers
- One simple example (website, app)

Avoid technical jargon.

---

## Key Takeaway

**A server is a computer that serves other computers.**

Servers power:
- Websites
- Apps
- Databases
- Cloud systems
- Data pipelines

Without servers,
modern technology cannot exist.

---

## Discussion Questions

- Did you know your phone talks to servers all the time?
- Have you heard of cloud servers before?
