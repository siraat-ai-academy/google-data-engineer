# 0.3.3 What is the internet

---

## 1. Concept Explanation 

The **internet** is:

> **A global network that connects millions of computers and servers together.**

In simple words:
- Internet = computers talking to other computers
- This communication happens using cables, signals, and rules

Your phone, laptop, and servers are all connected through the internet.

---

## 2. One-Line Definition (Easy to Remember)

**Internet = network of networks**

It connects:
- Computers
- Servers
- Mobile phones
- Cloud systems

All over the world.

---

## 3. Daily-Life Example (Very Clear)

### Example: Opening a Website

When you type:
```

[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)

```

What happens:
1. Your device sends a request
2. Request goes through internet
3. Google’s server receives request
4. Server sends response back
5. Website appears on your screen

All this happens in **milliseconds**.

## 4. Internet Is NOT One Thing (Important)

Internet is NOT:
- A single computer ❌
- A single server ❌
- A single company ❌

Internet IS:
- Many computers
- Many servers
- Many networks
- Connected together

No one owns the whole internet.

---

## 5. How Computers Talk on the Internet (Simple Idea)

Computers talk using:
- Requests
- Responses

Just like conversation:
- You ask a question
- Other side replies

Example:

This back-and-forth creates the internet experience.

Internet allows:
- Browsing websites
- Sending emails
- Using apps
- Watching videos

- Cloud computing

Almost everything digital today depends on the internet.

In data engineering:
- Data moves through the internet
- Cloud services are accessed via internet
- Data pipelines send data between systems using internet

Examples:

- Cloud job processes data
- Results are accessed over internet

Without internet:
- Cloud cannot work
- Data pipelines stop
- Remote systems fail

---

## 8. Common Beginner Misunderstandings

Beginners often think:

- Internet = browser ❌

Reality:

- Internet is the **connection behind everything**

---

## 9. Interview Angle (Beginner Level)
