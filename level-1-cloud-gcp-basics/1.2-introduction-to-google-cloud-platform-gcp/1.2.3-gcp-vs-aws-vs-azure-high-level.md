# 1.2.3 GCP vs AWS vs Azure (high-level)

---

## 1. Concept Explanation 

**GCP, AWS, and Azure** are the **top three cloud platforms** in the world.

They all provide:
- Cloud computing
- Storage
- Networking
- Data & analytics services

Difference is **not about capability**,  
difference is about **focus, ecosystem, and strengths**.

---

## 2. One-Line Summary (Easy to Remember)

- **AWS** → First mover, very wide services  
- **Azure** → Strong with Microsoft & enterprises  
- **GCP** → Strong with data, analytics, and scale  

All three are powerful.

---

## 3. High-Level Comparison Table

| Area | AWS | Azure | GCP |
|----|----|----|----|
| Company | Amazon | Microsoft | Google |
| Market age | Oldest | Second | Third |
| Enterprise usage | High | Very High | Growing |
| Data & analytics | Good | Good | **Excellent** |
| AI / ML | Strong | Strong | **Very Strong** |
| Ease for beginners | Medium | Medium | **High** |
| Pricing style | Complex | Complex | **Cleaner** |

---

## 4. AWS (Amazon Web Services) — High Level

### What AWS Is Known For
- First cloud platform
- Largest number of services
- Very mature ecosystem

### Who Uses AWS
- Startups
- Enterprises
- Almost every industry

### Strengths
- Massive service catalog
- Global reach
- Large community

### Weakness (Beginner View)
- Can feel complex
- Many similar services

---

## 5. Azure (Microsoft Azure) — High Level

### What Azure Is Known For
- Deep integration with Microsoft products
- Strong enterprise adoption

### Who Uses Azure
- Enterprises
- Companies using:
  - Windows
  - Active Directory
  - Office ecosystem

### Strengths
- Enterprise trust
- Hybrid (on-prem + cloud) setups
- Microsoft tooling integration

### Weakness (Beginner View)
- Less intuitive for data beginners
- Heavier enterprise processes

---

## 6. GCP (Google Cloud Platform) — High Level

### What GCP Is Known For
- Big data
- Analytics
- Scalability
- Clean architecture

### Who Uses GCP
- Data-driven companies
- AI / ML heavy workloads
- Analytics platforms

### Strengths
- Excellent data tools (BigQuery, Dataflow)
- Simple concepts
- Strong performance
- Google-scale technology

### Weakness (High Level)
- Smaller market share than AWS/Azure
- Fewer legacy enterprise customers

---

## 7. Which Cloud Is Best for Data Engineering?

From **data engineering perspective**:

- **AWS** → many tools, more setup
- **Azure** → good, but enterprise-heavy
- **GCP** → **best out-of-box data experience**

That’s why:
> Many data engineers **prefer GCP** for analytics work.

---

## 8. Career Reality (Very Important)

Truth:
- Concepts are similar across clouds
- Skills are transferable
- Learning one cloud makes others easier

Hiring managers value:
- Cloud fundamentals
- Data engineering thinking
- Not memorised service names

---

## 9. Common Beginner Mistakes

Beginners often think:
- “I must learn all clouds” ❌
- “One cloud is useless” ❌

Reality:
- Learn **one cloud deeply**
- Understand **concepts**
- Switch clouds later if needed

Depth > breadth.

---

## 10. Interview Angle (Beginner Level)

Interviewers may ask:
- Difference between AWS, Azure, and GCP?

Strong answer:
- High-level differences
- Focus areas
- One data-engineering reason

Avoid:
- Service-by-service listing
- Fan-boy answers

---

## Key Takeaway

**AWS, Azure, and GCP all do cloud computing.  
They differ in focus, ecosystem, and strengths.**

For data engineering:
> **GCP shines in analytics and simplicity.**

---

## Discussion Questions

- Which cloud feels most interesting to you?
- Do you want depth in GCP or general cloud understanding?
