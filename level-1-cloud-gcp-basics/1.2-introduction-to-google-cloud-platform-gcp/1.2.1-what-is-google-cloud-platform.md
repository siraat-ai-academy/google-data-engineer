# 1.2.1 What is Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

---

## 1. Concept Explanation 

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is:

> **A cloud platform by Google that lets companies use computing, storage, and data services over the internet.**

In simple words:
- Google owns powerful computers (servers)
- These computers live in data centers
- Companies rent these resources instead of buying their own

You use Google’s infrastructure  
→ via the internet  
→ and pay only for what you use.

---

## 2. One-Line Definition (Easy to Remember)

**Google Cloud Platform = Google’s cloud services for building and running applications and data systems**

---

## 3. Why Google Built GCP

Google built GCP to:
- Share the same technology it uses internally
- Help companies build scalable systems
- Support big data and analytics
- Enable modern cloud-based businesses

GCP is built on:
- Google’s global network
- Google’s data center technology
- Google’s experience with massive scale (Search, YouTube, Gmail)

---

## 4. What Can You Do with GCP?

Using GCP, companies can:

- Run applications
- Store data
- Process big data
- Analyse data
- Build data pipelines
- Run machine learning models

GCP provides **tools + infrastructure** together.

---

## 5. GCP in Very Simple Categories

At high level, GCP provides:

### 1️⃣ Compute
- Virtual machines
- Processing power

### 2️⃣ Storage
- Store files
- Store backups
- Store data

### 3️⃣ Databases & Data Services
- Data warehouses
- Streaming systems
- Analytics tools

### 4️⃣ Networking & Security
- Connect systems
- Secure access

You don’t manage hardware.  
Google manages it for you.

---

## 6. GCP in Data Engineering (Very Important)

For Data Engineers, GCP is mainly used for:

- Data ingestion
- Data processing
- Data storage
- Data analytics

Examples:
- BigQuery → data warehouse
- Dataflow → data pipelines
- Cloud Storage → raw data storage

Modern data engineering jobs **heavily use GCP services**.

---

## 7. Why Companies Choose Google Cloud Platform

Companies choose GCP because:

- Strong data & analytics tools
- Excellent scalability
- Competitive pricing
- Global infrastructure
- Strong security
- Easy integration with modern systems

GCP is especially popular for:
- Data engineering
- Analytics
- AI / ML workloads

---

## 8. Common Beginner Misunderstandings

Beginners often think:
- GCP is only for Google ❌
- GCP is only for big companies ❌

Reality:
- Startups use GCP
- Enterprises use GCP
- Individuals can use GCP

Anyone can learn and use it.

---

## 9. Interview Angle (Beginner Level)

Interviewers may ask:
- What is Google Cloud Platform?

Good answer:
- It is Google’s cloud platform
- It provides computing, storage, and data services over the internet
- One example (BigQuery, cloud storage)

Simple explanation is best.

---

## Key Takeaway

**Google Cloud Platform lets you use Google’s powerful infrastructure to build and run data systems in the cloud.**

It is a core platform for:
- Cloud computing
- Data engineering
- Analytics
- Modern tech careers
