# 1.3.3 Billing basics (GCP)

---

## 1. Concept Explanation 

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **billing** means:

> **How Google charges money for the cloud resources you use.**

Very simple idea:
- If you use resources → you pay
- If you don’t use resources → you don’t pay

GCP follows:
> **Pay-as-you-go model**

---

## 2. One-Line Definition (Easy to Remember)

**Billing = tracking and paying for cloud usage**

---

## 3. Important Billing Components in GCP

There are **three key parts** you must understand:

1️⃣ **Billing Account**  
2️⃣ **Project**  
3️⃣ **Resources usage**

All billing flows through these.

---

## 4. What Is a Billing Account?

A **Billing Account** is:

> **Where payment information is stored and charges are collected.**

Billing account contains:
- Credit card / payment method
- Invoices
- Cost reports

One billing account can be linked to:
- One project
- Or **many projects**

---

## 5. How Billing Account and Project Work Together

Very important rule:

> **Every GCP project must be linked to a billing account to use paid services.**

Example:
- Billing Account → Company credit card
- Project → `data-analytics-prod`

All costs from that project:
👉 Go to the linked billing account

---

## 6. What Do You Actually Pay For?

In GCP, you pay for:
- Compute usage (CPU, memory)
- Storage usage (GB stored)
- Data processing
- Network usage

You usually **do not pay** for:
- Creating a project
- Using console UI

You pay when:
👉 Resources start running or storing data

---

## 7. Pay-as-You-Go (Very Important)

Pay-as-you-go means:
- No upfront payment
- No long-term contract
- Pay only for usage

Example:
- Use server for 1 hour → pay for 1 hour
- Stop server → billing stops

This gives:
- Cost flexibility
- Low risk for beginners
- Easy experimentation

---

## 8. Budgets and Alerts (Cost Control)

GCP allows you to:
- Set **budgets**
- Create **alerts**

Example:
- Budget: $50 per month
- Alert at: 80%, 90%, 100%

This helps:
- Avoid surprise bills
- Control learning cost
- Protect company budget

---

## 9. Billing in Real Companies (Job Context)

In real jobs:
- Billing is taken very seriously
- Engineers are expected to be cost-aware

Data Engineers must:
- Design cost-efficient pipelines
- Monitor expensive queries
- Avoid unused resources

Bad billing design:
- Wastes money
- Reduces trust
- Creates problems with management

---

## 10. Common Beginner Mistakes

Beginners often:
- Forget to delete resources ❌
- Leave servers running ❌
- Ignore billing alerts ❌

Result:
- Unexpected charges

Best habit:
> Always stop or delete what you don’t use.

---

## 11. Interview Angle (Beginner Level)

Interviewers may ask:
- How does billing work in GCP?

Good answer:
- Billing account is linked to project
- Charges are based on usage
- Pay-as-you-go model

Simple + clear is enough.

---

## Key Takeaway

**Billing in GCP is usage-based and project-linked.**

Understanding billing helps you:
- Save money
- Design better systems
- Act like a responsible engineer

---

## Discussion Questions

- Why is project-level billing useful?
- How would you avoid surprise bills?
